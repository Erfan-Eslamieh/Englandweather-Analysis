# 🌦 England Weather Analysis - Climate Insights through Data Visualization

Understanding Weather Patterns to Support Decision-Making in Agriculture, Infrastructure, and Urban Planning

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Weather analysis plays a vital role in understanding climate trends, supporting agricultural planning, and managing urban infrastructure. This project utilizes the **"England Weather Dataset"** to analyze meteorological data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and precipitation type.

Through data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies in historical weather records. The project highlights seasonal variations, extreme weather events, and the interdependence of different weather factors. These insights can inform climate adaptation strategies and help develop predictive models for future planning.
